# Hogwarts Registrar

**Hogwarts Registrar** is a web app that showcases relational databases and allows the user to add, delete, and update data in the system. 
It utilizes many to many relationships and many to one relationships to generate data in the system.

It was designed using Python, Flask, and MySQL in the backend, and Bootstrap and Javascript for the UI.

It was developed by Melissa Lagunas and Nishant Tharani in the Fall of 2020 for the Introduction to Database course at Oregon State University.
